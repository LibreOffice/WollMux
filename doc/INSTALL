Instructions for compiling and installing WollMux

== Prerequisites ==
=== Required software ===
The following software needs to be installed in order to build WollMux.

- Apache Ant version 1.6.2 or greater (http://ant.apache.org/)
- Java SDK 1.6 or later (http://java.sun.com/)
- OpenOffice.org 3.0 or later
- OpenOffice.org SDK 3.0 or later
- (optional, for building Debian package) dpkg-dev, fakeroot
- (optional, for working with development snapshot) git
- (optional, for building the Windows installer) nsis

=== Miscellaneous issues ===
- If ant gives you the error "Unable to locate tools.jar...." you need to set 
  the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the root of a Java SDK installation, 
  rather than just a JRE.

- The binaries from the OOo SDK need to be in the PATH. You may also need to
  set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the OOo programs/ subdirectory. A quick
  test to see if your OOo SDK is properly installed is to issue the
  following command on the command line:

     idlc

  If you get the following usage message

    using: idlc [-options] <file_1> ... <file_n> | @<filename> | -stdin
    [...]

  then your OOo SDK is set up correctly.

== Getting the sources ==

You can either get a release tarball or checkout the development version
from the public git repositories.

Option 1: Release tarball

- Go to http://wollmux.projects.forge.osor.eu/ and download the source tarball
  wollmux-<version>.tar.gz

- Extract the tarball somewhere. This will create a directory
  named wollmux-<version>/

Option 2: Using development sources from git

- WollMux requires an additional project for building, so start by creating
  a top-level directory for holding all the necessary projects.

    mkdir wollmux-git

- Next, change into the new directory and check out all of the required 
  projects from their respective git repositories.

    cd wollmux-git
    git clone https://github.com/WollMux/WollMux.git
    git clone https://github.com/WollMux/UNOHelper.git

=== classes.tar.gz ===

The WollMuxBar.jar binary includes certain bootstrap files from OpenOffice.org.
OpenOffice.org's license, the GPL, requires that whenever you pass on the
WollMuxBar binary to someone else, you provide that person with the sources
to those bootstrap files. Normally, WollMux will be built with the bootstrap
files from your installation of the OpenOffice.org SDK. Since the GPL requires
that you provide the complete corresponding source, whenever you distribute
a WollMux built like this, you must distribute the complete OpenOffice.org
sources in exactly the same version that was used to build that SDK. Unless you
already distribute OpenOffice.org's sources, this requirement may be too tough
for you (who wants to distribute several 100M just to be allowed to pass on one
small file like WollMuxBar.jar?). 

If you desire strict GPL-compliance without having to distribute the complete
OOo sources, then you can download classes.tar.gz and extract it in the 
directory that contains the WollMux and UNOHelper subdirectories before building
WollMux. The build will pick up this classes/ directory automatically. A message
is output right at the beginning of the build to tell you which bootstrap files 
are being used, so you can verify you've set up classes/ correctly.

classes.tar.gz includes binaries and source code for the bootstrap
files and all files necessary to build the binaries from the source. Whenever
you distribute a WollMuxBar.jar built with these files, you can satisfy your
GPL obligations by distributing classes.tar.gz (in addition to the WollMux
sources whose distribution is required by the EUPL).

Rebuilding classes.tar.gz on a Debian system requires the package mingw32.

== Building WollMux ==

- Go to the directory wollmux-<version>/WollMux and open the file build.xml
  in an editor of your choice.
    cd WollMux
    $EDITOR build.xml

- Change the properties OOO_TYPES_DIR, OOO_OFFAPI_DIR, OOOCLS1, OOOCLS2 and 
  OOO_SDK to match your system. This is *required*. The default paths WILL NOT 
  work for you. The comments in build.xml tell you, which files or directories
  are supposed to be in the respective directories. Simply locate these
  files/directories on your system to determine the proper values for the
  properties. Typical settings for a Windows system are listed in a comment 
  below the property definitions.

- If you want to compile WollMux without building a Debian package, issue
  the command

    ant clean all

  If ant gives you the error "Unable to locate tools.jar...." you need to set 
  the environment variable JAVA_HOME to the root of a Java SDK installation, 
  rather than just a JRE.

=== Building a Debian package ===

- To build a Debian package, issue the command

    ant clean deb

  The package will be found in the dist/ directory.

  ATTENTION! If you build from vanilla sources, this Debian package will NOT work
  on a standard Debian or Ubuntu system. If you want a Debian package that works
  on these systems, you will have to add a debian/ directory inside the WollMux
  directory. If debian/ is present, it will be used. Otherwise the lhmdeb/ 
  directory is used, which only works for the Landeshauptstadt MÃ¼nchen's 
  Basisclient.

== Building a Windows installer ===

- To build a Windows installer, issue the command

    ant wininstaller
    
  The installer executable will be found in the dist/ directory.
  You need to have NSIS installed on your system for this to work and
  makensis needs to be on the path.

== Installing WollMux ==

- On a Debian system, simply install the Debian package built in the
  previous step with dpkg -i.

- On Windows you can use the installer executable built above.

- For a manual installation, terminate all running OpenOffice.org processes
  (including the quickstarter), then install the OpenOffice.org extension
  with the following command:

    unopkg add --shared dist/WollMux.oxt

  This will result in a system-wide installation and usually requires
  administrator privileges. The command line tool unopkg can be found in the
  program-subfolder inside your OpenOffice.org installation directory.
  For a user installation, launch OpenOffice.org, 
  go to the menu Tools/Extension Manager and use Add to install the
  extension.
